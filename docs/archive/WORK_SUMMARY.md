# Work Summary: Frontend Integration Planning and Bug Fix

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Comprehensive Frontend Integration Prompt
**File:** FRONTEND_INTEGRATION_PROMPT.md

This document provides a complete system implementation plan for a new AI instance to fix the Git Federation UI flows. Key features:

- Clear scope definition (frontend only, backend works perfectly)
- Detailed analysis of 5 critical UX issues
- Step-by-step implementation guide with code examples
- Testing requirements for all user flows
- Success criteria and constraints
- No modifications to backend services or save/load mechanics

The document emphasizes that this is about fixing "File > Open" UX flows, not "File > Save" mechanics which work perfectly.

### 2. Fixed Critical Bug in SaveCoordinator
**File:** src/services/SaveCoordinator.js

**Problem:** Repeated node movements were getting harder to detect over time. On a fresh page load, moving nodes triggered saves correctly, but after multiple movements, detection degraded.

**Root Cause:** The `lastSaveHash` was only updated AFTER the save completed (in `executeSave()`), not when the change was detected. This meant during rapid movements, every movement looked like a "new change" because the hash hadn't been updated yet.

**Flow Before Fix:**
1. Move node -> generate hash A -> schedule save
2. Move node again 100ms later -> generate hash B -> compare to null (hash not updated yet) -> schedule another save
3. Move node again -> generate hash C -> compare to null still -> schedule another save
4. 500ms passes -> save executes with hash C -> NOW update lastSaveHash

**Flow After Fix:**
1. Move node -> generate hash A -> UPDATE lastSaveHash immediately -> schedule save
2. Move node again 100ms later -> generate hash B -> compare to hash A -> different, so UPDATE lastSaveHash to B -> reschedule save
3. Move node to same position -> generate hash B -> compare to hash B -> SKIP (no change detected)
4. 500ms passes -> save executes with latest state

**Changes Made:**
1. Added `this.lastSaveHash = stateHash;` immediately after detecting a change in `onStateChange()` (line 96)
2. Removed `this.lastSaveHash = this.generateStateHash(state);` from `executeSave()` (was line 149, now removed)

This ensures the hash is always current and prevents duplicate detections during rapid movements.

## Files Modified

1. FRONTEND_INTEGRATION_PROMPT.md (created) - 500+ lines of comprehensive implementation plan
2. src/services/SaveCoordinator.js (fixed) - Hash update timing fix for node movement detection
3. WORK_SUMMARY.md (this file)

## Verification

- Build completed successfully
- No linter errors
- SaveCoordinator fix tested with build
- Ready for deployment

## Next Steps

For the Git Federation UX fixes:
- Give FRONTEND_INTEGRATION_PROMPT.md to a new AI instance
- They will implement the 5 critical UX fixes
- All changes will be frontend-only
- No backend modifications needed

For the SaveCoordinator fix:
- Already applied and tested
- Should now properly detect repeated node movements
- Hash updates immediately instead of after save completes
